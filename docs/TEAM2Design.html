<h1>TEAM Engine Design</h1>

<h3>Overview of TEAM Engine</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEAM Engine is a test script interpreter.  It executes tests
and test suites written as Compliance Test Language (CTL) scripts.  There is a
core command line version of TEAM Engine, as well as a web application for
executing test suites from a browser.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Technologies</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TEAM Engine is written using Java (JDK 1.5 or greater).  It
is tightly coupled to the Saxon XSLT engine (version 9).  The web version uses
Java servlets and JSP.  Its authentication code depends on Apache Tomcat
(version 5 or greater).  Some of the web pages use javascript/DHTML/AJAX.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>High Level Design</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here is the one paragraph explanation of how TEAM Engine
works.  When a test suite is executed, the source CTL files are converted into
XSL files, a separate XSL file for each test.  TEAM Engine presents the form for
the test suite to the user.  The values the user enters are parameters to the
starting test, and they are converted into parameter XML.  Then the starting test
is executed by starting a Saxon transformation using the parameter XML as input
and the XSL file that was generated for the starting test as the stylesheet.
The XSL code makes calls to java extension functions.  These include a method for
calling a subtest, which works by performing another Saxon transformation using the
XSL that was generated for the subtest.  The transformations write output to the
console and generate log files as they progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>TEAM Engine Core</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The files in the apps/engine directory include the core TEAM
Engine files and the lightweight command line utility applications.  An
explanation of the basic processes and concepts involved follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>XSL Generation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When tests are executed using the Test utility in test mode
(the default), the first step is to convert the source CTL files into XSL files. 
This is done using the generateXsl method in the Generator class.  XSL files are
generated for each ctl:test and each ctl:function that contains code.  Each
source file is processed as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:38.1pt;text-indent:-18.7pt'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Determine
the destination directory for the XSL files that will be generated.  It will be
a subdirectory of the working directory.  Its name is the full path of the
source file, with special characters like slashes and backslashes escaped. 
Create the destination directory if it doesn't already exist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:38.1pt;text-indent:-18.7pt'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Compare
the date of the source file to the date of "index.xml" in the destination directory.
 If the source file is newer, the XSL files do not need to be regenerated. 
Skip to step 6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:38.1pt;text-indent:-18.7pt'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Validate
the source file against the CTL schema.  If validation fails print the
validation errors and go on to the next source file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:38.1pt;text-indent:-18.7pt'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Remove
any previously generated files from the destination directory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:38.1pt;text-indent:-18.7pt'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Transform
the source file using the generate_xsl.xsl stylesheet.  This stylesheet creates
an XSL file in the destination directory for each ctl:test and each
ctl:function that contains code.  The result document is an index file that
contains info on each top-level CTL construct (test, function, suite, etc.) in
the source file.  Save the result document as "index .xml" in the destination
directory.  If the transformation fails, go on to the next source file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:38.1pt;text-indent:-18.7pt'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read
the index file into an instance of the Index class.  Add each index entry into
a master instance of the Index class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If there were any validation errors or transformation errors
this process returns an Exception.  Otherwise, it returns the master index of
top-level CTL constructs as an instance of the Index class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Initialize Execution Context</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the source files have been generated and indexed, the
next step is to initialize an execution context.  This is done by creating an
instance of the Engine class.  The Engine class is instantiated just once. In
the web application, it is initialized on startup and shared across all test
sessions. The main initialization tasks are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><b>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Initialize
and configure the Saxon processor</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Multiple transformations take place
during execution of a test session, but they all the use the same Saxon processor
which is initialized and stored in the "processor" member variable.  The
processor is configured to use TEFunctionLibrary, which tells Saxon how to bind
to the proper code when an XPath expression it is executing calls for a
function defined by a ctl:function tag.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><b>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Initialize
a cache of stylesheets</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Parsing stylesheets with Saxon can
take some time, and the loaded stylesheets can take quite a bit of memory. 
Past versions of TEAM Engine loaded all of the code for all of the tests into
memory on startup, which caused long initialization times, required lots of
memory, and did not scale well.  Now, TEAM Engine loads a separate stylesheet
on demand for each ctl:test and ctl:function.  Since these stylesheets may be
used many times, we maintain a cache of the most recently used loaded
stylesheets (executables).  These are stored in the loadedExecutables member
variable.  When an executable is needed, it may be obtained using the loadExecutable
method.  If necessary, the least recently used executable(s) are freed to make
room to load a new executable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'><b>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Initialize
class loaders</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>In the web application, it is not
unusual to have several test suites that depend on different versions of the
same class or resource.  To allow for this, a separate instance of
TEClassLoader is instantiated for each group of source files.  The
TEClassLoader will first attempt to load resources from its group's resources
directory and then fall back to the standard TEAM Engine resources if a
group-specific resource is not found.  The class loaders for each group are
stored in the "classLoaders" member variable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Execute a Test Suite</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the execution context has been initialized, executing
the test suite can begin.  To start execution, an instance of the TECore class
is created and its "execute" method is invoked.  If the test suite has an
associated form, it is displayed.  The values the user entered on the form are
converted to XML in memory.  The starting test for the suite is retrieved from
the master index, and its associated XSL file is loaded as an executable
stylesheet.  The transformation is performed using the XML containing form
values as input and the TECore object itself as a transformation parameter.  The
result of the transformation is ignored, but output is written to the console
and log files are generated as side effects while the transformation
progresses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the transformation process, Saxon calls callback methods
on the TECore object as directed by the stylesheet it is executing.  The
methods that may be called are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><b>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>callTest
</b>- This method executes a test.  Parameters are the namespace URI and local
name of the test to call, an XML representation of the parameters to pass to
the test, and a call ID string.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>A &lt;testcall&gt; element is
written in the current test's log file.  A new directory is created in its log
directory using the callid parameter as its name.  A new file named log.xml is
created in this directory for the new test.  A &lt;starttest&gt; element that
identifies the test and the values of the parameters passed to it is written to
the new log file.  The test name and assertion are also written to the console. 
The stylesheet associated with the test to be called is loaded.  It is executed
using the XML representation of the parameters as input and the TECore object itself
as a transformation parameter.   When execution is complete, an &lt;endtest&gt;
element indicating the test results is written to the log file.  The results
are also written to the console.  If the result is fail, it causes the active
test to fail also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><b>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>callFunction
</b>- This method executes a function. Parameters are the namespace URI and
local name of the test to call, an XML representation of the parameters to pass
to the function.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>If the function being called is a
CTL function, the stylesheet associated with the function is loaded.  It is
executed using the XML representation of the parameters as input and the TECore
object itself as a transformation parameter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>If the function is a Java
function, the Java reflection API is used to find the Java function with a
compatible signature and invoke it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><b>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>fail,
warning </b>- These methods set the test result for the active test (the TECore
result member variable).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><b>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>form</b>
- This method displays a form, waits for user input, and returns the values the
user entered in the form fields. Parameters are an XHTML representation of the
form and a form instance ID string.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>If TEAM Engine was started using
the test command line application, this method creates a window using the Java
Swing toolkit and displays the form XHTML in a JEditorPane control.  When the
user presses the submit button on the form, an XML representation of the form
fields and their values is returned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>If TEAM Engine was started as a
web application, the form XHTML is saved in the formHtml member variable, and
the function blocks until values have been returned in the formResults member
variable.  The client (browser) regularly polls the server for status, and
receives the form XHTML in the formHtml variable when it is available.  It
displays the form.  When the user presses the submit button on the form, an XML
representation of the form fields is set in the formResults variable.  This
method returns those results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>A &lt;formresults&gt; element
containing the values the user entered is written to the log.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><b>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>request
</b>- This method submits an HTTP request and returns the results. Parameters
are an XML representation of the request and a request instance ID string.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The request is sent using a standard
Java URLConnection.  The request XML may include a parser instruction, which
indicates how the response should be parsed into XML.  This will refer a parser
defined as a top-level CTL element (either in the sources loaded or as a
built-in parser defined in the parsers.ctl resource) and cataloged in the
master index.  Parsers may be declared as initialized or uninitialized.  If the
parser is not initialized, it refers to a static java method to use for extracting
XML.  The method is invoked, and the parsed XML is returned.  If the parser is
initialized, the method it refers to is not static and its class must be
instantiated.  The member variable parserInstances stores instantiated parser
objects.  The parser object is retrieved from this variable.  If it does not already
contain an instance of the parser, the parser is instantiated and added to the
list.  Its parsing method is invoked, and the parsed XML is returned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>A &lt;request&gt; element
containing the request and the parsed result is written to the log.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'><b>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>message
</b>- This method writes a message to the console.  The message is also written
to the log in a &lt;message&gt; element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Resume Mode - </b>If a TEAM Engine test session is
interrupted while it is running, execution can be resumed by executing the
session again in resume mode.  Execution proceeds as when starting a new test
session, except that the behavior of the TECore callback methods callTest,
form, and request is altered.  When mode is resume, the callTest method will
first check to see if a log file for the subtest to be executed exists and has
completed.  If so, then it just reads the results from the log rather than
actually executing the XSL for the subtest.  Similarly, the form method will
use the form results from the log if they exist rather than displaying the form
to the user again, and the request method will use the response from the log if
it exists rather than actually submitting the http request again.  Execution
will proceed very quickly until it reaches the end of the log files where the session
was first interrupted.  Then subtest calls, forms, and requests will become
active again, and execution will proceed at a normal pace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Retest Mode </b>- Specific tests from a previously executed
test session may be executed again, perhaps after modifying a web service that
the test calls.  In retest mode, TEAM Engine starts a transformation with the
executable stylesheet associated with the test to be reexecuted.  The input XML
is a representation of the parameters to pass to the test, read from the log file
for the previous execution.  Retest mode should be used cautiously since the parameters
for the test are not recalculated.  If the parameters to a test were taken from
a web service, the parent test may need to be reexecuted as well when the web
service is modified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>TEAM Engine Web</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The files in the apps/manager directory are installed along with
the core TEAM Engine files for the web application.  An explanation of the
basic processes and concepts involved follows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Configuration Info</b> - Configuration settings are stored
in a file called config.xml.  It contains settings such as the work directory
where the generated XSL files are stored, the user's directory where user login
information and session log files are stored, and information about the available
test suites. The Config class parses this information and makes it available in
member functions.  Servlets and JSP pages that need this information can
instantiate a Config class in their init or jspInit method.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Authentication</b> - Authentication is required before
users have access to the test sessions page for creating a test session or
viewing existing sessions.  TEAM Engine uses it own custom Tomcat realm, UserFilesRealm. 
It looks for a directory for the user to be authenticated, and reads the password
entry from a file called user.xml in that directory, and authenticates the user
if his password matches.  Authentication is for user management rather than
security.  Users that don't have an account can create their own account with
the registration link.  The registration form is processed by
RegistrationHandlerServlet, which creates the directory for the user and the
user.xml file with his password.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Test Execution</b> - Test execution involves a great deal
of cooperation between client (the browser executing javascript) and the server. 
When the user creates a test session, the browser is directed to the test.jsp
page.  When the page is loaded, it starts test execution on the server by
submitting an AJAX request to the Test servlet with parameter te-operation=Test. 
When the Test servlet receives this request, it starts a new Thread, which
creates a TECore object and starts the Saxon transformation (as described above
in the core execution process).  The servlet returns some XML that contains the
id of the thread it started.  The client continues by opening a new window to
display console output, and by setting up a javascript timer to poll the server
for status when a short time period has elapsed.  When the timer expires, it
sends a request to the Test servlet with parameter te-operation=GetStatus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When TEAM Engine is running in web mode, the console output
is cached in a variable rather than written to standard out.  Every time the
server receives a request for status, it sends the cached console output and
clears the cache.  It also sends a form flag and an execution flag.  The client
writes the output it received to the console window.  The form flag indicates
whether the server is waiting for form input.  If so, the content frame in the
browser is redirected to the Test servlet with parameter te-operation=GetForm,
which displays the form.  When the user presses submit, it is directed back to
the Test servlet with parameter te-operation=SubmitForm, which supplies the
values the user entered so that test execution can resume.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The client continues to poll the server for status until the
execution flag indicates the session is complete.  Then it loads the results
page.</p>
